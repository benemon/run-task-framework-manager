# Terraform Run Task Scaffolding (Golang)

This repository is a *template* for a [Terraform Cloud](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cloud-docs/workspaces/settings/run-tasks) and/or [Terraform Enterprise](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/enterprise/workspaces/settings/run-tasks) run task. It is intended as a starting point for creating Terraform run tasks, containing:

- A service handler for handling run task request/response (`internal/runtask/run_task_handler`),
- A scaffolding template file for configuring the service or business verification logic of the run task (`internal/runtask/run_task_scaffolding`),
- Miscellaneous meta files.

These files contain boilerplate code that you will need to edit to create your own Terraform run task. Detailed documentation for run task integration can be found on the  [HashiCorp Developer](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cloud-docs/integrations/run-tasks) platform.

Please see the [GitHub template repository documentation](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template) for how to create a new repository from this template on GitHub.

## Requirements

- A Terraform Cloud account or Terraform Enterprise >= v202206-1
  - To create a run task, you must have a user account with the [Manage Run Tasks](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions#manage-run-tasks) permission. To associate run tasks with a workspace, you need the [Manage Workspace Run Tasks](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions#general-workspace-permissions) permission on that particular workspace.
- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) >= 1.20

## Using The Run Task in TFC or TFE

_We highly recommend using a tunneling solution like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to quickly test your run task on your local machine._

1. Run the run task service using the Go `run` command:

    ```shell
    go run main.go
    ```

   - Alternatively, you can run the service in debug mode with breakpoints using a debugger or an IDE
2. Take note of the `path`, `hmac`, and `addr` values configured in `internal/runtask/run_task_scaffolding.Configure()`
    - Default values: `path` = `/runtask`, `hmac` = `secret123`, `addr` = `:22180`

3. (Optional) If you are using a tunneling solution, run and configure it to use the same port (`addr` value) that the run task service is running on.

3. Verify that the run task service is running by calling the `/healthcheck` endpoint: 

    ```shell
    curl -v -H "Content-Type: application/json" <Service URL>/healthcheck
    ```

5. Follow the steps on the Hashicorp Developer platform for [Creating a Run Task](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cloud-docs/workspaces/settings/run-tasks#creating-a-run-task) and [Associating Run Tasks with a Workspace](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cloud-docs/workspaces/settings/run-tasks#associating-run-tasks-with-a-workspace)
   - For the **Endpoint URL** field, append the `path` value to the end of your service's URL, ex: `http://myservice.io/runtask`
   - For the **HMAC key** field, use the configured `hmac` value 



## Adding Dependencies

This run task uses [Go modules](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules).
Please see the Go documentation for the most up-to-date information about using Go modules.

To add a new dependency `github.com/author/dependency` to your Terraform run task:

```shell
go get github.com/author/dependency
go mod tidy
```

Then commit the changes to `go.mod` and `go.sum`.
